# scEMAIL
Universal source-free annotation method for scRNA-seq data via novel cell-type perception and multi-order affinity constraints

we propose a universal transfer learning-based annotation framework for scRNA-seq data called scEMAIL, which automatically detects novel cell types without accessing source data during adaptation.
